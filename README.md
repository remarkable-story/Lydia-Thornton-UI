# Lydia-Thornton-UI


This marketing/sign up page was created as a frontend to a React app. It is completely laid out from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a LESS compiler. I included mobile first responsive design, an accordian used to organize the page, and card selector tabs that select cards based on data-tabs.


### Getting Started

1. Fork and Clone the Repo
2. run less-watch-compiler
3. edit to your heart's desire

Each gray bar unfolds to reveal a different section and an interactive tableau map in included too.
